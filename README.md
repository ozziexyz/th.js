# th.js
tiny (99 byte) hexadecimal/decimal conversion library

add with `<script src='th.js'>`

## convert decimal to hexadecimal
`th.toHex(YOURNUM)`

## convert hexadecimal to decimal
`th.toDec(YOURNUM)`

This was originally a lot longer and bigger (like 189 bytes), but then it stopped working. I don't care what anyone says ED jokes are hilarious.
